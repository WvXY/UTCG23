    <h2>Assignment 1: Spline</h2>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>In this assignment, I decided to draw a circle using NURBS(Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline). <br>
        When I was doing architecture design, I often used a 3D modeling software called Rhinoceros,
        which uses NURBS to make precise 3D models.
    </p>

    <canvas id="glCanvas" width="600" height="600"></canvas>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    <p>As you can see, so far there are some problems. One problem is, it doesn't support editing, so you can't change the parameters here.
        In order to draw something different, (e.g, change/add more control points, change weights, etc.)
        you have to edit the source code, which is to some extent, not user-friendly. <br>
        Another problem is that I am an amateur. I don't know how to draw 2 objects in one canvas using WebGL.
        I might fix it in the next update.</p>

    <h4>TO-DO(maybe in the next assignment)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Allow editing</li>
        <li>Draw multiple objects(axis, control points, etc.) using webGL</li>
    </ul>
