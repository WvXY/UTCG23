    <h2>Assignment 1: Spline</h2>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>In this assignment, I decided to draw a circle using NURBS(Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline). <br>
        When I was doing architecture design, I often used a 3D modeling software called Rhinoceros,
        which uses NURBS to make precise 3D models.
    </p>
    <p id="output">The problem is, it doesn't a GUI, so it can't be changed in this page.
    In order to draw something different, (e.g, add more control points, change weights, etc.)
    you have to edit the source code, which is to some extent, not user-friendly. </p>

    <h4>TO-DO(maybe in the next assignment)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Allow edit </li>
        <li>Draw multiple objects in webGL</li>
    </ul>
